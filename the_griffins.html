Peter works part-time at the Pawtucket Brewery where he ships out case and cases of beer to their favorite Liquor Bar in Quahog where he spends most of his free time with his three best friends, Glen Quagmire, Cleveland Brown, and Joe Swanson, the Druken Clam or "The Clam", which they call it. Peter is the main character and most peculiar male character in the entire series, other than Quagmire.

He also has an elderly man stalking him and trying to get his hands on him the first chance he gets, which is Mr. Herbert, who seems to enjoy chasing after little, teenage, and even adult males.

            Meg Griffin is the sister of Chris and Stewie Griffin. She is also the daughter of both Lois and Peter Griffin. Meg is the most disrespected character in the show. There has been scenarios where someone in the show thinks Meg is a male, a thing, or in most cases, DISGUSTING! Meg tries hard to get boyfriends that would like her for who she is, not her personality, but nothing checks out for her.

            Brian Griffin is the pet of the family. Peter Griffin adopted Brian when he was found abandoned on the streets of Quahog. Brian spends most of his time picking up hot chicks anytime he sees them in a relationship, not in a relationship, or just married. He also spends some time at the Druken Clam to take in a couple of drinks after the fun or before the fun takes place. Brian seems to be the smartest and most educated out of the entire Griffin family. Like me, he has a very sarcastic tone in his voice.

Stewie spends most of his time planning world domination for Quahog and making everyone suffer. You may or may think that just because Stewie is just a baby, he can't do anything. Listen to this..... (1)He has his entire secret closet of preposterous weapons of destruction;MOSTLY MILITARY ARTILLIARY. (2)He talks at an early age of 1. Most babies won't start actually saying words until they're about 4 or 5 years old. (3)He wants to kill his mother for some reason he thinks she is a disgrace to the family or just his life alone. (4)He built his own time machine. (5) HE USES VULGAR LANGUAGE!!
