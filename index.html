                                <p>RUST COLLEGE was established in 1866 by the Freedman's Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Its founders were missionaries from the North who opened a school in Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church, accepting adlits
                                    of all ages, as well as children, for instruction in elementary subjects. A year later the first building on the present campus was erected.In 1870, the school was chartered as Shaw University, honoring the Reverend
                                    S.O. Shaw, who made a gift of $10,000 to the new institution. In 1892, the name was changed to Rust University to avoid confusion with another Shaw University. The name was a tribute to Richard S. Rust of Cincinnati,
                                    Ohio, Secretary of the Freedman's Aid Society. In 1915, the title was changed to the more realistic name, Rust College. As students progressed, high school and college courses were added to the curriclium, and in 1878
                                    two students were graduated from the college department. As public schools for Negroes became more widespread the need for private schools decreased, and in 1930 the grade school was discontinued. The high school continued
                                    to function until 1953.</p>
