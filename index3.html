                                Shaw, who made a gift of $10,000 to the new institution. In 1892, the name was changed to Rust University to avoid confusion with another Shaw University. The name was a tribute to Richard S. Rust of Cincinnati, Ohio, Secretary
                                of the Freedman's Aid Society. In 1915, the title was changed to the more realistic name, Rust College. As students progressed, high school and college courses were added to the curriclium, and in 1878 two students were
                                graduated from the college department. As public schools for Negroes became more widespread the need for private schools decreased, and in 1930 the grade school was discontinued. The high school continued to function until
